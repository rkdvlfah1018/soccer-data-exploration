1. Parse data to train a machine learning model for all passes.
	- need to check if the original data only contains a complete pass.
	- ideally, you would want to have all attempts, so that you can train a model
		to pick out a pass given a situtation

If the original data contains all attempts, you want each row to have
	- start position (x,y)
	- end position (x,y)
	- passer (x,y)
	- receiver / intended receiver 
		(how would I get this? I could look at the game play, what else?)
	- success or failure
	- evaluation of the pass (what are the components that make it a good pass?)
